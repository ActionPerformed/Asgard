# Asgard

Asgard was part of my final project when I was studying. It is a simple game in JSwing/Android that allows the player to move freely in some previous maps that can be created with the editor tool. In Asgard you can interact with some items or NPCs and you can use your mobile device as a fishin rod for fishing in water zones

It is compound by 3 modules:

- Asgard (Java): The game itself.
- Eitr (Java): The map editor.
- SkidBladnir (Android): The android application. It is used for saving the progress and as a fishing rod

Currently, Asgard + Eitr are here in GitHub but not Eitr (I'll upload it soon, I hope). 

You are free to download te code and make as many changes as you wish. It can be improved for sure, because it was done when I have no experience in this field
